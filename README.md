# semverlog - semantic versioning meets changelogs

The semantic versioning specification (https://semver.org) gives us a tool sanely evolve software.
However, as a library grows and perhaps gets split into multiple smaller ones, it can be difficult to keep track of the semver impact of a series of changes.

`semverlog` aims to solve this problem by allowing you to describe each change and its semver impact in a separate file under the `.changes` directory.

## Design philosophy

- **Zero configuration**: `semverlog` implements a very opinionated workflow.
  This allows it to operate without a configuration file, avoiding clutter in your repository.
- **Scalable**: With `semverlog`, each change (typically introduced in a single PR), is described in a separate file.
  This avoids merge conflicts in otherwise often touched files like `CHANGELOG.md` or manifest files.
- **Correct**: One of the biggest challenges in maintaining a large library is correctly tracking semver.
  With `semverlog`, you can record the semver impact of your change together with the code.
  This makes releases stress-free.
- **Flexible**: Despite being free of configuration files, `semverlog` aims to flexible where possible.
  For example, we don't integrate with package managers, instead `semverlog` requires you to pass in the current version of the package as an argument.
- **Contributor-friendly**: You can use `semverlog` as a maintainer without forcing your contributors into it.
The change file format is simple and the name doesn't matter, meaning contributors can create entries without installing the tool.

## Usage

1. Within your repository, create a directory named `.changes`.
2. Add a markdown file (name irrelevant) for each change (i.e. pull request).

Upon release time, call `semverlog compute-bump-level <CURRENT_VERSION>` to compute the next version bump.

To generate a changelog entry, call `semverlog compile-changelog <NEW_VERSION>`.
This will compile all entries within `.changes` together, sorted by priority and creation time.

## Change file format

A change file is a markdown file with a yaml front-matter:

```markdown
---
kind: added|fixed|changed|removed|deprecated|security
breaking: true|false
priority: 0-10
---
<CHANGE_TEXT>
```

`breaking` and `priority` are optional.

By default, the `changed` and `removed` kind are considered a breaking change, unless overridden with `breaking: false`.

`<CHANGE_TEXT>` will be output verbatim upon `semverlog compile-changelog`.
It is recommended to stick to paragraphs and not add any extra headings to avoid formatting problems.
If you want to add headings, take into account that all changes are within sections of level-3 (`###`) headings, i.e. `### Added` etc so you want to start your headings at level 4 within the changelog entry.

## Recommended workflow

- Squash-merge your PRs: This will ensure the change file is committed together with the actual change.
- Delete change files within `.changes` after each release.
  `semverlog` will always consider the entire `.changes` directory.
